# Social Media Variety Geolocation Task (SMG)

The SMG task consists of three subtasks focusing on three different language areas:
- DEAT: Jodel conversations initiated in Germany and Austria,
- CH: Jodel conversations initiated in German-speaking Switzerland,
- BCMS: geolocated tweets published in the area of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

The test data contains one instance per line. You will submit a file of the same length containing two numerical values per instance, the latitude coordinate and the longitude coordinate. The two values are separated by a tab character, for example:

44.81827513<tab>20.2262884<linebreak>

To make processing easier, we ask you to follow these instructions:
- Each team may submit a maximum of 3 submissions per subtask.
- Please include the subtask name (DEAT/CH/BCMS) and your team name in the file names.
- Please tell us in the e-mail message if your submissions are constrained (i.e., only use the VarDial training data) or unconstrained (i.e., use additional data such as external corpora, lexicons or pre-trained embeddings).
